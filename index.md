Welcome to my homepage!

I am an assistant professor in Accounting at Erasmus School of Economics (ESE), Erasmum University Rotterdam (EUR). Motivated by real-life issues, my research focus broadly on managerial accounting, corporate governance, and ESG topics. In particular, my papers examine how to design control and incentive systems to motivate and support employees and managers, to balance strategic behaviors and long-term goals of organizations. 

I have taught various courses, incluidng programming, managerial accounting, financial accounting, seminar management control, and introduction to accounting research. Additionally, I supervise master students for their theses.
